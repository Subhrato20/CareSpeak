# LLM Integration for Symptom Search Tool

## Overview
The `symptom_search_tool.py` has been enhanced with LLM (Large Language Model) integration to provide more natural, conversational responses for voice communication.

## What Was Changed

### 1. Added OpenAI Integration
- **Imports**: Added `openai` and `httpx` imports for LLM functionality
- **Environment Variables**: Added support for `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- **Client Initialization**: Added OpenAI client initialization with proxy handling

### 2. Enhanced SymptomSearchTool Class
- **New Method**: `_chat_completion()` - Compatibility wrapper for OpenAI API calls
- **New Method**: `format_results_for_voice()` - Main formatting method with LLM fallback
- **New Method**: `_format_results_with_llm()` - LLM-powered natural language generation
- **New Method**: `_format_results_fallback()` - Template-based fallback formatting

### 3. LLM-Powered Response Generation
The new system provides:
- **Natural Language**: Conversational, friendly responses
- **Context Awareness**: Mentions user symptoms and provides relevant recommendations
- **Safety Disclaimers**: Always includes medical consultation advice
- **Product Information**: Includes prices, ratings, and reviews naturally
- **Fallback Support**: Graceful degradation to template formatting if LLM fails

## Key Features

### Natural Language Output
Instead of structured lists, the LLM generates responses like:
> "Oh, dealing with a headache and fever is never fun, but there are a few options that might help ease your symptoms. If you're looking for something specifically to target pain relief and reduce fever, you might want to consider Tylenol Extra Strength Acetaminophen. It's well-rated with a 4.5 out of 5 stars from over 1,250 reviews, and is priced at $12.99..."

### Fallback Mechanism
- **Primary**: LLM-generated natural language responses
- **Fallback**: Template-based formatting if LLM is unavailable or fails
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with informative messages

### Configuration
- **Optional**: LLM integration is optional - works without OpenAI API key
- **Environment**: Uses `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable
- **Proxy Support**: Handles proxy configurations automatically

## Usage

### With LLM (Recommended)
```python
# Set OPENAI_API_KEY in environment
tool = SymptomSearchTool()
results = tool.search_products_by_symptoms("headache")
formatted_response = tool.format_results_for_voice(results)
```

### Without LLM (Fallback)
```python
# No OPENAI_API_KEY needed
tool = SymptomSearchTool()
results = tool.search_products_by_symptoms("headache")
formatted_response = tool.format_results_for_voice(results)  # Uses fallback
```

## Benefits

1. **Better User Experience**: More natural, conversational responses
2. **Contextual Information**: Better integration of symptoms and recommendations
3. **Professional Tone**: Maintains medical disclaimers and safety advice
4. **Flexibility**: Works with or without LLM capabilities
5. **Reliability**: Robust fallback mechanisms ensure always functional

## Requirements
- `openai>=1.3.0` (already in requirements.txt)
- `httpx>=0.27.2` (already in requirements.txt)
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable (optional)

## Testing
The integration has been tested with:
- Sample data formatting
- Actual Amazon search results
- Fallback scenarios
- Error handling

All tests pass successfully, demonstrating both LLM-powered natural language generation and reliable fallback functionality.
